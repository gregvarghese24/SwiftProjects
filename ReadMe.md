# Welcome to my Swift Projects Repository 

In this repository, each folder contains a small swift app/project that is able to be run on xCode. 

Each folder will have a summary description here:


## MUSIC GENRE SELECTOR APP

  This is my first app in Swift. I created a music genre player for the iPhone 11 that allows
  the user to select a genre and play music in that genre in the user's music library. 
    - Features include a basic UI button layout, permissions to access iPhone music library, error handling
      button assignment/functionality
    
### NEXT SWIFT PROJECT COMING SOON...
